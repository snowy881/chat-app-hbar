# Hedera Consensus Service Chat Tutorial

An example web app which demonstrates how you can use decentralized pub-sub messaging on the Hedera Consensus Service.


The `TOPIC_ID` is used when connecting to an existing topic. If you don't have one, you can leave it as is.

After downloading and setting up our environment, we'll install our packages via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

```
npm install
```

If installing the dependencies was succesful, now try to run the server!

```
node server.js
```

After running your server, it will prompt you to configure your chat, e.g.

```
1. What mode do you want to run in?  <--- "Default", "Minimal", "Debug"
2. What's your account ID?           <---  defaults to the .env schema
3. What's your private key?          <---  defaults to the .env schema
4. Should we create a new HCS topic, or connect to an existing one?
```

If everything was configured properly, the chat should now open at a random port location.

You can additionally run another instance of the chat application by creating a new terminal, and running the application again. This will find another unused, random port location, and deploy multiple instances to your local machine. With the environment configurability, you can test out multi-client chats.
